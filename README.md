## **Reflection**

The project is meant to showcase full stack Application build with the usage of external API, Database, and creation of my own API, as well as existing Style Libraries

I took as a foundation an existing project https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_travel_advisor

It includes React Google Map Component and Rapid API.

Things I added:
 - GoogleSignIn functionality
 - MongoDB to add user and user's favorite places. 
 - Mobile Responsivnes
 - New components and functionality: 
      Skeleton Component instead of Loading Circle 
      Map Mark with Tooltip - clicking on Mark will navigate you to a place in the List. 
      Hovering on Location from List will highlight this location on the Map.
